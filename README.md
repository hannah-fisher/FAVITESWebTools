# FAVITESWebTools

A series of web tools to increase ease of use of FAVITES (https://github.com/niemasd/FAVITES).<br>

**Configuration file designer:** https://hannah-fisher.github.io/FAVITESWebTools/ConfigDesigner/.<br>
This site allows the user to create a configuration file for use with FAVITES by selecting implementations for each module, and then entering values for the required parameters of each module implementation. The site also ensures that the selected combination of module implementations is valid by pulling the dependencies and requirements from the FAVITES_ModuleList.json file in the FAVITES GitHub repository.
