# FAVITESWebTools

A series of web tools to increase ease of use of FAVITES (https://github.com/niemasd/FAVITES).

Configuration file designer: https://hannah-fisher.github.io/FAVITESWebTools/ConfigDesigner/.
  This site allows the user to create a configuration file for use with FAVITES by selecting implementations for each module, and then entering values for the required parameters of each module implementation. The site also ensures that the selected combination of module implementations is valid by pulling the dependencies and requirements from the FAVITES_ModuleList.json file in the FAVITES GitHub repository.

TreeN93 cluster visualizer: https://hannah-fisher.github.io/FAVITESWebTools/TreeN93-Distance/.
  This site allows the user to visualize a phylogenetic tree and its clusters created from a TN93 distance threshold. Tree files in the Newick format can be uploaded. The distance threshold can be chosen by inputting a value into a text box, or by moving a slider. The site allows the user to visualize the clusters both by the coloring of branches on the tree, and with buttons to preview and download a file assigning each node name to a cluster number.
